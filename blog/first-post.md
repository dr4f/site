The data we use and see is stored in a variety of different formats. Text, images, emails, videos, logs, spreadsheets, a nearly infinite amount of channels and formats. In programming, most of the data that applications deal with is *object-oriented* data. Data can be considered object-oriented if it contains fields or keys which hold values. Almost anything can be *modeled* as an object. The power of processing object-oriented data can provide incredible insights and services in software.

## What exactly is an object?

The term "object" can be a bit ambiguous, it carries different meanings in different settings. In programming, *object* refers to some compound data structure that can be constructed and destroyed. These objects are usually *defined* in the respective language through writing the structure of the desired object.


## Storage Formats

Data, particularly object-oriented is commonly stored in several document formats. `CSV`, `JSON`, `XML`, the list goes on and on. Data objects are also stored in binary formats, like `BSON`. Binary formats can usually store data in either less space or more detailed information. Databases, for example, almost always store data in binary objects.

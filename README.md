*The modern, binary objected-oriented data format*


## Intro

`dr4` is a revolutionary file format that allows, quick, scalable, and organized access to object oriented data. However, unlike file and data formats such as `JSON` or `XML`, `dr4` is unique in that it's binary. `dr4` is also designed to be readable and writable without any parsing or handling overhead. Additionally, it can also be used much like `CSV`, easily appendable or joinable with other `dr4` documents, without the hassle.

## Rows

`dr4` is based around the concepts of rows.

## Spec

You can find the detailed binary spec o this page.

# `0.0.1`

*Specification for dr4 version `0.0.1`* 

## Notes

* This is the second overall specification for `dr4`, that requires the use of versions in documents.
* Prior to this spec, no formal header or body document structure had been defined.

## Document

A `dr4` document shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, that includes a document header, document body, and a termination sequence.


### Document Header

A `dr4` document header shall be defined as a sequence of eight unsigned 8-bit integers at the beginning of the document. These are designated as follows:

> * Bytes 1-3 are the magic sequence: 83, 94 and 121.
> * Bytes 4-6 are the version bytes.
> * Byte 7 is the sizer byte for varieties.
> * Byte 8 is reserved for future use.

**Note**: This version of the `dr4` spec is non-standard. It does not enforce the presence of a version in the beginning of a document, nor a size variety.

### Document Body

A `dr4` document body shall be defined as a series of *data rows*, terminated by a 4-byte sequence, all of which have the value 0.

> * A document body is always terminated by 0 0 0 0, also read as \x00\x00\x00\x00

## Rows

A `dr4` row shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, which includes a header, body, and stop byte.

### Row Header

A `dr4` row header shall be defined as sequence of either unsigned  8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit integers, which represent the size, length, and offsets of the row. The header values are defined as follows:

> * Bytes 1-4 of the header are an unsigned (8, 16, or 32-bit) integer holding the row size.
> * Bytes 5-8 of the header are an unsigned (8, 16, or 32-bit) integer holding the row length.
> * The row length shall never be greater than the row size.
> * The row length shall never be zero.
> * The row size shall never be zero.
> * Bytes 9-f of the header are a sequence of unsigned (8, 16, or 32-bit) integers.

The offset array of the row header's end byte, f, is derived by the following formulas:

> 8-bit  `f = 2 + length - 1`
> 16-bit `f = 4 + (length * 2) - 1`
> 32-bit `f = 8 + (length * 4) - 1`

The offset of a row's field is defined as the first byte of the field at an offset of `n` bytes from byte `0` of the row's body. The rules of the offsets held within a row header's offset array are defined as:

> * An offset value is never greater than the size of the row.
> * No two offset value's can be the same within the same row.
> * The length of the row and the size of the offset array must always be equal.
> * The first offset in the offset array is always `0`.
> * Each row must always have at least one offset.

### Row Body

A `dr4` row body shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, that is terminated by a stopping byte. The stopping byte is an unsigned 8-bit integer with a value of `0`. The contents within the row body correspond to the typed fields which hold the data of the `dr4` format. 

## Types

A type shall be defined as a unique, 8-bit unsigned integer with indicates the type of data stored within a field. A type mark is defined as the first byte of each type, which indicates the type.

#### Notation

The binary notation used adheres to the format:

```
\x01 == 1 == 00000001
 |      |       |
 fmt    dec    binary 
```

The max value for a byte is `\x255` and the minimum is `\x00`.

### Type Listings

The types supported by this specification are as follows:

```

 STOP                     \x00

 . simple types .
......................................

 NONE                     \x01
 BOOL                     \x02

 UI16                     \x04

 SI32                     \x09
 SI64                     \x10
 SGFN                     \x11
 DBFN                     \x12
 ```

 *Note* : `FN` refers to floating-point number. 

### STOP

The stoppage byte. This byte is always present at the end of a row body, and thus, the entire row itself.

### BOOL

The `bool` type is a data type with a size of `2` bytes. The first byte is the bool type byte, `\x02`, while the second byte holds the state. `\x01` corresponds to the true state, and `\x00` for the false state.

### UI08

The `UI08` type is an 8-bit unsigned integer. The first byte is the `UI08` type byte, the second byte is the value between `0, 255`.

### UI16

The `UI16` type is a 16-bit unsigned integer. The first byte is the `UI16` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `0, 65535`

### UI32

The `UI32` type is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The first byte is the `UI32` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `0, 4294967295`

### UI64

The `UI64` type is a 64-bit unsigned integer. The first byte is the `UI64` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `0, 18,446,744,073,709,551,615`

### SI08

The `SI08` type is an 8-bit signed integer. The first byte is the `SI08` type byte, the second byte is the value between `-127 , 127`.

### SI16

The `SI16` type is an 16-bit signed integer. The first byte is the `SI16` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `-32767 , 32767`.

### SI32

The `SI32` type is a 32-bit signed integer. The first byte is the `SI32` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `0, 4294967295`

### SI64

The `SI64` type is a 64-bit signed integer. The first byte is the `SI64` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the value between `−9,223,372,036,854,775,807, +9,223,372,036,854,775,807`

### SGFN

Single precision floating point number type. Equivalent to a `float` data type in the C language. The first byte is the `SGFN` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the float itself.

### DBFN

Double precision floating point number type. Equivalent to a `double` data type in the C language. The first byte is the `DBFN` type byte, the remaining bytes represent the float itself.

# `0.0.1`

*Specification for dr4 version `0.0.1`* 

## Notes

* This is the second overall specification for `dr4`, that requires the use of versions in documents.
* Prior to this spec, no formal header or body document structure had been defined.

## Document

A `dr4` document shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, that includes a document header, document body, and a termination sequence.


### Document Header

A `dr4` document header shall be defined as a sequence of eight unsigned 8-bit integers at the beginning of the document. These are designated as follows:

> * Bytes 1-3 are the magic sequence: 83, 94 and 121.
> * Bytes 4-6 are the version bytes.
> * Bytes 7 and 8 are reserved for future use.

### Document Body

A `dr4` document body shall be defined as a series of *data rows*, terminated by a 4-byte sequence, all of which have the value 0.

> * A document body is always terminated by 0 0 0 0, also read as \x00\x00\x00\x00

## Rows

A `dr4` row shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, which includes a header, body, and stop byte.

### Row Header

A `dr4` row header shall be defined as sequence of unsigned 32-bit integers, which represent the size, length, and offsets of the row. The header values are defined as follows:

> * Bytes 1-4 of the header are an unsigned 32-bit integer holding the row size.
> * Bytes 5-8 of the header are an unsigned 32-bit integer holding the row length.
> * The row length shall never be greater than the row size.
> * The row length shall never be zero.
> * The row size shall never be zero.
> * Bytes 9-f of the header are a sequence of unsigned 32-bit integers.

The offset array of the row header's end byte, f, is derived by the following formula:

> `f = 8 + (length * 4) - 1`

The offset of a row's field is defined as the first byte of the field at an offset of `n` bytes from byte `0` of the row's body. The rules of the offsets held within a row header's offset array are defined as:

> * An offset value is never greater than the size of the row.
> * No two offset value's can be the same within the same row.
> * The length of the row and the size of the offset array must always be equal.
> * The first offset in the offset array is always `0`.
> * Each row must always have at least one offset.

### Row Body

A `dr4` row body shall be defined as a sequence of bytes, that is terminated by a stopping byte. The stopping byte is an unsigned 8-bit integer with a value of `0`. The contents within the row body correspond to the typed fields which hold the data of the `dr4` format. 

## Types

A type shall be defined as a unique, 8-bit unsigned integer with indicates the type of data stored within a field. A type mark is defined as the first byte of each type, which indicates the type.

#### Notation

The binary notation used adheres to the format:

```
\x01 == 1 == 00000001
 |      |       |
 fmt    dec    binary 
```

The max value for a byte is `\x255` and the minimum is `\x00`.

### Type Listings

The types supported by this specification are as follows:

```

 STOP                     \x00
 ```
